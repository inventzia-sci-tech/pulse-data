## Code structure for schemas
```
├── schemas-yaml/  # Single source of truth for data models

```        

- Single Source of Truth: JSON Schema files define everything
- Autogenerated code for each supported language for strong typing benefits
- JSON Format: Human-readable, easy debugging

See the [schemas generation README](./schemas/schemas-generators/readme.md) for more details on how to autogenerate
the .py files and .java classes from the yaml definitions.
